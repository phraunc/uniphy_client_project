## Description
 "Itâ€™s not always easy to keep track of where your life is headed nowadays.
We all go through some ups and downs and sometimes get overwhelmed by all the things we need to keep in balance to stay on a healthy track.
The idea behind the app is that there are 5 big pillars contributing to our overall mental state, and that each of these, when in imbalance, can affect our mood and energy negatively.
The balance score is a simple yet holistic way of tracking the most fundamental aspects of a healthy lifestyle, as it aims to give the users an overview of their sleep, their physical activity, their nutrition, their social activity, and their occupations.
The goal is that the users develop the habit of using the app for just 10 to 15 minutes a day and that over time, the user develops the self-awareness to take on bettering the aspects of their lives that are hindering them in reaching their full potential and living up to their dreams."

When the App starts at the beginning of each day the score is at zero and the goal is to reach the score of 500 points of total wellness! 
There are 5 core pillars of focus.  Each pillar is worth up to 100 points, which means each pillar: movement, social activity, food, sleep, and occupation, are equally important.

## Getting Started

This project should be able to run in your favorite IDE. we used VS code while building it. 
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"><img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/vscode/vscode-original-wordmark.svg" height="40px" width="40px" /></a>

### Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostgresSql] (https://www.postgresql.org/) or your SQL Database of your choice.


### Installation

1. Fork the repository
2. Copy the SSH key in your new repository
3. In your terminal type...  `git clone {paste SSH link}`
4. Navigate into the repository's folder in your terminal
5. Open VS Code (or editor of your choice) and open the folder
6. In the terminal of VS Code run `npm install` to install all dependencies
7.  Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
8. Create a database named `uniphy_balance_score` in PostgresSQL
If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change `uniphy_balance_score` to the name of your new database name in `server/modules/pool.js`
9. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables that you need, as well as a dummy data table to test the app. Copy and paste those queries in the SQL query of the database. If this is going to production, leave out the dummy data.
10. Run `npm run server` in your VS Code terminal
11. Open a second terminal and run `npm run client`

## Usage

Once everything is installed and running it should open in your default browser - if not, navigate to http://localhost:3000/#/.

## Deployment
- Login Credentials for Heroku have been provided in the hand off document.
- If you need make changes you wish to push to the deployed app, you must login, go into the Uniphy section, go to the deploy tab, and then manually deploy. You can reconfigure this to redeploy automatically if you wish, which is on the same page.
- Environment variables are kept on Heroku in the Settings tab, just click the Reveal Config Vars button
- To set up the DB, we used Postico, just plug the information from Heroku into a new favorite. The Information for this can be found in the Resources tab, by clicking the Postgres add on. From there it will bring you to a new page where you will go into the settings tab and click view credentials. 

- If you'd like to create new users (also a hacky way to change password) you must:
1. Go into the user router
1. Uncomment the route
1. Push changes and redeploy app
1. Register User
1. Comment out the route back in VSCode
1. Push changes
1. Redeploy
